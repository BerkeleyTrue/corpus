# Out of the tar pits

## 1

Complexity is the single most major difficulty in successful software
develepment

* The major contributor to complexity is
  * handling state and the burden it adds to trying to analyse a system
  * code volume
  * flow of control


## 2 Complexity

* is the root cause of a vast majority of software
* Complexity destroys understanding.
* being able to think and reason about a system is crucial to performance
* complexity has a way of compounding difficulty
* The price of reliability is the persuit of of the utmost simplicity

> The first method is far more difficult.
>> - C. A. R. Hoare (1980)

* creating and maintaining such systems causes us to expend huge resources


## 3 Approaches to Understanding

* testing: attempting to understand a system from the outside
* informal reasoning: attempting to understand the system from the inside
* A key problem of testing
  * it doesn't tell you anything about the behavior system when a diff set of
    inputs is used
  * "have we perfomed the right tests?"


> Testing is hopelessly inadequate...(it) can be used very effectively to show
> the presence of bugsbut never to show their absense.
>> - Edsger W. Dijkstra (1971)

* Rely on testing at your peril.

> Invest in simplicity
