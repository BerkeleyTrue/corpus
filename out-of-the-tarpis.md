# Out of the tar pits

## 1

Complexity is the single most major difficulty in successful software
develepment

* The major contributor to complexity is
  * handling state and the burden it adds to trying to analyse a system
  * code volume
  * flow of control


## 2 Complexity

* is the root cause of a vast majority of software
* Complexity destroys understanding.
* being able to think and reason about a system is crucial to performance
* complexity has a way of compounding difficulty
* The price of reliability is the persuit of of the utmost simplicity

* creating and maintaining such systems causes us to expend huge resources
